    "# Brent Oil Prices Data Analysis Workflow\n",
    "\n",
    "## Introduction\n",
    "\"\"\"\n",
    "This notebook outlines the data analysis workflow for studying the relationship between Brent oil prices and major global events.\n",
    "The objective is to provide data-driven insights on how political, economic, and social events impact Brent oil prices.\n",
    "\"\"\"\n",
    "\n",
    "## Section 1: Data Analysis Workflow Steps\n",
    "\n",
    "### Step 1: Data Loading and Preprocessing\n",
    "\"\"\"\n",
    "- Load Brent Oil Prices data from the CSV file.\n",
    "- Check for missing values, outliers, and data consistency.\n",
    "- Convert date columns to datetime format and set up the data for time series analysis.\n",
    "\"\"\"\n",
    "\n",
    "### Step 2: Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)\n",
    "\"\"\"\n",
    "- Visualize trends, seasonality, and possible correlations within the data.\n",
    "- Identify key statistics (e.g., mean, median) and examine distribution of oil prices over time.\n",
    "\"\"\"\n",
    "\n",
    "### Step 3: Model Selection and Initial Hypotheses\n",
    "\"\"\"\n",
    "- Review time series models like ARIMA, GARCH, or Bayesian models.\n",
    "- Define initial hypotheses on how events might correlate with oil price changes.\n",
    "\"\"\"\n",
    "\n",
    "### Step 4: Assumptions and Limitations\n",
    "\"\"\"\n",
    "- Note assumptions (e.g., stationarity of data for time series models).\n",
    "- Identify limitations, such as external data dependencies or non-stationary events.\n",
    "\"\"\"\n",
    "\n",
    "### Step 5: Communicating Results\n",
    "\"\"\"\n",
    "- Determine the channels (e.g., report, blog post) and formats (e.g., visualizations, summary tables) for sharing insights.\n",
    "\"\"\"\n"
